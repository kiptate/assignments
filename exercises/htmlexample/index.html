            <p>Planning family meals takes a lot of work and creativity, especially when it comes to allergies, pickiness and tantrums at the table. Don’t forget the pressure parents feel to feed their kids healthy, balanced — even cute — meals that need to be free of all chemicals, additives and artificial anything. Please understand that this may be impossible.</p>
            <p>Yes, providing a child’s growing body with the best nutrition a grocery budget will allow is incredibly important. But when it comes to raising children in a modern food world, guiding them to learn how to nourish their bodies while feeling relaxed around “forbidden” foods can get complicated.</p>
            <p>Forbidden foods are foods that are deemed unhealthy in our society. While everyone seems to have different definitions of this term, these foods are highly rewarding. They are typically high-fat, high-sugar foods like cookies, candy, other desserts and chips. When these foods are restricted they can become evening more rewarding, which may cause the eating experience to feel out of control.</p>
            <p>While science doesn’t support this theory, this is the reason why many people believe rewarding foods are addictive.</p> 
            <p>Restriction can often make an individual feel addicted to forbidden food. Restriction comes in many forms. Many parents aren’t aware of the ways they might be practicing restriction. Getting rid of all forbidden food in the house or establishing strict rules around food are some obvious examples. Some more subtle examples may be saving treats for only special occassions or limiting baking to "healthier" or "protein-packed" versions of dessert recipes.</p>
            <p>According to Ellyn Satter, a registered dietitian and family therapist, restricted children eat more high-calorie snack foods than children who are allowed regular access to forbidden foods. Additionally, a restricted child will likely eat more of these foods when given the chance and may feel bad about it, causing them to hide wrappers from their parents.</p>
